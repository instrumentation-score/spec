**Rule ID:** RES-002

**Description:** `service.instance.id` is unique across logical resources within a given `service.name`.

**Rationale:** The `service.instance.id` uniquely identifies a resource, however, it's being misused when another resource attribute is present indicating that two workloads are sharing the same `service.instance.id`. This rule is particularly important as it negates the effects of RES-001—having a `service.instance.id` provides no value if it's not unique across resources.

**Target:** Resource

**Criteria:** The `service.instance.id` resource attribute MUST be unique across logical resources, e.g., different Kubernetes pods. 

**Impact:** Important

**Examples:**

* Resource attribute `service.instance.id` is set to `abc` when the `k8s.pod.name` is set to `payment-abc123`. The same ID `abc` is also seen on telemetry coming from `k8s.pod.name` set to `payment-def456`
