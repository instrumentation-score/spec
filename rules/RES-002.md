**Rule ID:** RES-002

**Description:** Misused `service.instance.id`

**Rationale:** The `service.instance.id` uniquely identifies a resource, however, itâ€™s being misused when another resource attribute is present indicating that two workloads are sharing the same `service.instance.id`.

**Target:** Resource

**Criteria:** The `service.instance.id` resource attribute is present. 

**Impact:** Important (so that it negates the effects of RES-001)

**Examples:**

* Resource attribute `service.instance.id` is set to `abc` when the `k8s.pod.name` is set to `payment-abc123`. The same ID `abc` is also seen on telemetry coming from `k8s.pod.name` set to `payment-def456`

**Type:** Negative
