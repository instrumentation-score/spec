**Rule ID:** RES-003

**Description:** Missing `k8s.pod.uid` in telemetry collected from applications running on a Kubernetes cluster, or from the control pane of the Kubernetes cluster itself.

**Rationale:** The `k8s.pod.uid` resource attribute enables correlation of telemetry through the `k8sattributeprocessor` and similar facilities that, unlike `k8s.pod.ip`, is robust against service meshes (Istio, Linkerd).

**Target:** Resource

**Criteria:** The `k8s.pod.uid` resource attribute is present. 

**Impact:** Important

**Examples:**

* This is likely the actual issue the user is having [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/29630).

**Type:** Negative

**Note:** OpenTelemetry SDKs should strive to collect the `k8s.pod.uid` out of the box when deployed in Kubernetes-based applications, which is possible by parsing the `cgroup` metadata.[1]
