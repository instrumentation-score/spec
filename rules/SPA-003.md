**Rule ID:** SPA-003

**Description:** Span names are supposed to be low cardinality. HTTP and Database span names, depending on the instrumentation, can be high cardinality due to literals embedded in database queries, or literal URL paths instead of HTTP routes.

**Rationale:** High-cardinality span names impact the usefulness of group-by mechanics, reduce the effectiveness of filtering mechanics, and can blow up indexes in tools that rely on them.

**Target:** Span

**Criteria:** TODO
