**Rule ID:** LOG-001

**Description:** Debug-level logs are not enabled in production environments for longer than 14 days.

**Rationale:** Debug-level logging should generally not be enabled in production environments long-term. Retaining debug logs for extended periods in production can lead to increased storage costs, potential security concerns due to sensitive information being logged, and noisy logs that make troubleshooting more difficult. This rule helps identify situations where debug logging is left on inadvertently in production.

**Target:** Log

**Criteria:** Log records with `severity.text` \= `DEBUG` are not observed in a production environment for longer than 14 days, where a production environment is defined by the value of `deployment.environment.name` _Resource_ attribute.

**Impact:** Important
