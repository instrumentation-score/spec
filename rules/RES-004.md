**Rule ID:** RES-004

**Description:** Attribute namespaces from semantic conventions are not enforced by SDKs to appear “in the right place”, and end users tend to get them wrong when writing manual instrumentations.

**Rationale:** Semantic conventions not only specify the namespace keys and the intended meaning, but also at which level in OTLP they should be used, e.g., resource, log, span or metric datapoint. Some tools require end users to specify, upon querying, at which level to look for a matching key. Having, e.g., the `service.name` at inconsistent levels across telemetry hinders analysis.

**Target:** Resource, Log, Span

**Criteria:** Attribute keys specified in the semantic conventions appear at the right level in OTLP

**Impact:** Important

**Examples:**

* `service.name` in span attributes  
* `http.method` in resource attributes

**Type:** Negative
