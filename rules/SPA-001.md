**Rule ID:** SPA-001

**Description:** Detect services emitting more than a threshold number of internal spans within a single trace instance.

**Rationale:** Services producing an excessive number of internal spans may indicate inefficient or complex operations. This can impact observability and performance monitoring, making it harder to identify bottlenecks and troubleshoot issues.

**Target:** Span

**Criteria:** More than 10 spans within the service in a single trace have a `span.kind = SpanKind.SPAN_KIND_INTERNAL`.

**Impact:** Normal

**Type:** Negative
