**Rule ID:** MET-003

**Description:** A Metric name is not consistently associated with the same metric unit.

**Rationale:** Metric units are fundamental in understanding what a metric means, and how to analyze it. Metric units are specified in the OpenTelemetry SDKs when their instruments are created, and it is possible for different applications to use the same metric name with different metric units, creating chaos during analysis.

**Target:** Metric

**Criteria:** In the past 14 days, not all time series associated with a given metric name have the same unit.

**Severity:** Very Important

**Type:** Negative
