**Rule ID:** RES-005

**Description:** Resource attribute `service.name` must be present

**Rationale:** `service.name` represents the logical name of the service, and it is critical for service identification. This attribute is required by [OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions for Resources](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource/#service). Ideally, it must be the same for all instances of horizontally scaled services.

**Target:** Resource

**Criteria:** Resource attributes must contain a `service.name` key with a non-empty string value. The attribute must not be null, undefined, or an empty string.

**Examples:**

- "Resource attribute `service.name` is missing from the resource attributes."
- "Resource attribute `service.name` is present but has an empty string value."
- "Resource attribute `service.name` is present but has a null value."

**Impact:** Critical

**Type:** Negative
