**Rule ID:** SPA-002

**Description:** Traces do not contain orphan spans.

**Rationale:** Orphaned spans indicate potential issues in tracing instrumentation or data integrity. This can lead to incomplete or misleading trace data, hindering effective troubleshooting and performance analysis.

**Target:** Span

**Criteria:** Given any span with a `parent_span_id` reference, here MUST exist a span with the same trace id whose `span_id` equals that `parent_span_id` value.

**Impact:** Normal
