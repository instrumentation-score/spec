**Rule ID:** SPA-002

**Description:** Traces do not contain orphan spans.

**Rationale:** Orphaned spans indicate potential issues in tracing instrumentation or data integrity. This can lead to incomplete or misleading trace data, hindering effective troubleshooting and performance analysis.

**Target:** Span

**Criteria:** Given any span with a `parent_span_id` reference, there MUST exist a span with the same trace id and the value of `parent_span_id` as its `span_id`.

**Impact:** Normal
