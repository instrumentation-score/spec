**Rule ID:** SPA-004

**Description:** Span kind defines the type of operation that is being traced. In virtually all cases, with the exception of spans generated by the OTel Browser Bundle, `CLIENT` root spans are a sign of either missing instrumentation (e.g., a missing span of kind `SERVER` or `INTERNAL` to denote the beginning of a batch or headless workload), or the sign that trace context was lost within the application.

**Rationale:** Distributed traces are commonly used to describe interactions within components. A component receives a request, e.g., an HTTP server, or initiates a trace, e.g., an application running in a K8s Job: either case, the trace should begin with a span that describes which request is the application serving. Spans of kind `CLIENT` describe requests issued by an application towards another, and generally miss the context *why* that request is issued in the first place.
