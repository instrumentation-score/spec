**Rule ID:** MET-001

**Description:** Metric attributes have bound cardinality.

**Rationale:** High cardinality metric attributes can significantly degrade performance and increase storage costs of observability systems. They lead to a large number of unique time series, making it difficult to aggregate, query, and analyze metrics effectively. This rule helps identify and address such attributes.

**Target:** Metric

**Criteria:** All Metrics have attributes with less than 10.000 unique values per attribute key, observed within a 1-hour window.

**Impact:** Important
