**Rule ID:** MET-001

**Description:** A Metric has an attribute with excessively high cardinality.

**Rationale:** High cardinality metric attributes can significantly degrade performance and increase storage costs of observability systems. They lead to a large number of unique time series, making it difficult to aggregate, query, and analyze metrics effectively. This rule helps identify and address such attributes.

**Target:** Metric

**Criteria:** A Metric has an attribute with more than 10.000 unique values observed within a 1-hour window.

**Impact:** Very Important

**Type:** Negative
