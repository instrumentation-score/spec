**Rule ID:** LOG-002

**Description:** Log records have their `severityNumber` set.

**Rationale:** When using the filelog receiver of the OpenTelemetry Collector, or an equivalent way of reading logs from file, and converting them to OpenTelemetry Log records, it is common for adopters not to specify a way to parse the logâ€™s severity and transform it into the OTLP severityNumber fields. This leaves logs less actionable than they should be. 

**Target:** Log

**Criteria:** Log records with `severity.text` \= `UNSET` are not observed.

**Impact:** Important
