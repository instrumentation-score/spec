# Governance Model

## Overview

The Instrumentation Score Specification project operates under an **open governance model** designed to ensure transparency, community participation, and collaborative decision-making. This document outlines the governance structure and participation guidelines for the project.

## Current Status

**Current Host**: OllyGarden, Inc.  
**Future Goal**: Transition to neutral hosting under a recognized open-source foundation (such as the Cloud Native Computing Foundation or as part of the OpenTelemetry project)

This governance model is designed to facilitate the eventual transition to neutral hosting while maintaining the project's open and collaborative nature.

## Core Principles

1. **Openness**: All project activities, discussions, and decisions are conducted transparently in public forums
2. **Meritocracy**: Contributions and influence are based on merit, expertise, and constructive participation
3. **Community-Driven**: The project's direction is determined by the collective needs and input of the community
4. **Vendor Neutrality**: No single organization or vendor controls the project's technical direction
5. **Consensus Building**: Decisions prioritize consensus, with clear escalation paths when needed
